•	Two models are proposed; one is for nuclei detection and segmentation, and another one is for the classification of BC histopathology images.
•	The proposed CCP introduced the Deep U-Net SAM for nuclei detection and efficient segmentation.
•	The nuclei density is calculated using microns per pixel as an efficient measure to locate the nuclei in each patch.
•	The state-of-the-art is to trigger the model to learn more efficiently the essential features from the complex structure of the histopathology images.
•	The patches are clustered into Low Density (LD), Medium Density (MD), and High Density (HD) images.
•	The proposed SNN introduces SCNN and SDNN for the classification of BC by taking the clustered patches as input.
